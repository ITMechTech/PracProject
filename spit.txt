Top tips for choosing your baby boy name
Your baby boys's name is with him for life so that can mean narrowing your choice down to just one can feel like a daunting process. To make it feel a little easier, follow these top name-picking tips:
Think about names that mean a lot to your family. You may want to consider naming your child after a much-loved relative or there might be a significant name which has been passed down your or your partner's family for generations.
Consider options from other countries. If you or your partner have a strong link with another country, choosing a baby boy name from that part of the world is a great way of honouring that connection. You may also want to look at names from places you've loved to visit on holiday. 
Look at name meanings. Thinking about the meaning of the names you like can help you work out whether it is the one for you. Take a moment to consider the type of meaning you want your child's name to have. Do you want a strong, powerful, masculine name or something with a positive or heartwarming message? Perhaps you have an affinity for nature or you want a name which reflects your religious beliefs?
Troubleshoot your choices. Once you've drawn up a shortlist of names you like, take them for a test-drive to see whether they will work in reality. How does the name sound with your surname? What will the initials be? Do other people find it easy to pronounce or will your child have a lifetime of correcting others? Do other people find it simple to spell and, if not, does it matter to you that you and your child will probably have to keep correcting other's mistakes? What nicknames might people call your child? How can it be shortened?
Check how popular the names you like are. It’s a good idea to check out where your favourite baby boy names come in the top 100 list before you commit to one. And if it's high up on the list, ask yourself if you mind the prospect of your child sharing a name with a couple of future classmates or whether you'd prefer your boy's name to be as different as possible.

When do you have to choose your baby boy's name by?
New parents in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have 42 days to register their baby’s name once he is born. If you live in Scotland, you will be expected to register your baby’s birth (and name) within 3 weeks of his birth.
Once you have picked a name, contact your local register office for an appointment to go in and register your baby’s birth. 

You will need to take some identification with you to prove who you are and some registrars may ask to see your baby’s red book, which is their personal health record. When you register the birth, you will be asked your baby’s full name as well as details about when and where he was born.

The birth must be registered by the baby’s mother or father and if you are unmarried and go to the register office alone, you will have to take a declaration of parentage form signed by the other parent with you.
